Command line submission tool for the Mitoprot server
----------------------------------------------------

 

This tool simply submits multiple query sequences to the Mitoprot server from a
multi-fasta file.

-   Care should be taken not to overwhelm the server.

-   A per-query wait time can be set.

-   Results are written to an output file specified at runtime.
